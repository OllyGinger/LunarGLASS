LunarGLASS/GOO LLVM 3.2
  - Loop issues for LunarGLASS core
  - handle all derived classes of constant

Adapters and Common Builder
  - read/write from variably chosen vector component
  - discard from a function
  - fModf() support
  - test thread safety
  - modify for any missing metadata (metadata that disappears during optimizations but is needed by LunarGOO)?
  - some parts of code don't handle complex nesting within in/out structures
  - do different declaration decorations reusing the same structure need to replicate the heirarchical decorations?

Performance
  - fix difference between fReadData and fReadInterpolant: LLVM is optimizing multiple uses of one but not the other

Delivery checklist
 . update all TODO
 . all copyrights correct?
 . all components on linux
 . all components compile on MSVC debug
 . all components compile on MSCV release
 . memory leak tests
 . all other tests
 . list of changes
 . update documentation
